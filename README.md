# Fake-news-detection

Detection of fake news online is important in today's society as fresh
news content is rapidly being produced as a result of the abundance of technology that is present.
In the world of false news, there are seven main categories and within each category, the piece of
fake news content can be visual- and/or linguistic-based. In order to detect fake news, both
linguistic and non-linguistic cues can be analyzed using several methods. That is the main
purpose of our project.
